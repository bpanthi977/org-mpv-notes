* org-mpv-notes.el
Take notes in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] from media files playing in [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]].

From within org-mode, use this package to open a media (audio/video)
file in =mpv=. Then you can create links in org file to specific
timestamps within that media file. Later you can click on those links
to open and jump to that timestamp within the audio/video. The media
file can be any file format that =mpv= supports. It can even be link to
a youtube video, or file on network (See [[https://mpv.io/manual/master/#protocols][protocols]] supported by mpv).

Optionally, you can have =mpv= pause automatically when creating a
timestamp link, allowing you to concentrate on your writing. The
package allows you to take screenshots of the running media, which can
be viewed as inline images when running Emacs as a GUI program. Also
you can configure the package to pipe a screenshot to an external OCR
program and auto-magically insert the OCR-ed text to the org buffer.

*** Installation

+ This package is available on MELPA, so you should be able to install
  it from within Emacs.

: M-x package-install RET org-mpv-notes

+ In addition to this, you have to install either [[https://github.com/kljohann/mpv.el][mpv.el]] or [[https://github.com/isamert/empv.el][empv.el]].
  These package allow Emacs to open and control mpv. Both packages are
  available on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]].

: M-x package-install RET mpv

+ If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] you can add the following to your config:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-mpv-notes
    :commands (org-mpv-notes-mode org-mpv-notes-open))
  (use-package mpv)
#+end_src


*** Use

While taking notes in an org buffer you can open a media (video/audio)
using ~M-x~ =org-mpv-notes-open=. This will prompt for a media file and
open it in mpv. Now can insert notes/links using ~M-x~
=org-mpv-notes-insert-note= or ~M-x~ =org-mpv-notes-insert-link= or their
corresponding [[* Default keybindings][keybindings]].

If you already have a link for media file in the org buffer, you can
open it by clicking with mouse, or ~M-x~ =org-open-at-point= (~C-c C-o~).

Alternatively, you can open media file directly with either =mpv.el= or
=empv.el= without using =org-mpv-notes-open= . This package is flexible,
so it doesn't matter whether you open an org-mode buffer first or a
media file first, as long as you open the media file from within
Emacs.

At any point, you can control =mpv= either from within Emacs using the
[[* Default
keybindings][keybindings]] or corresponding commands.

**** Default keybindings

The org-mpv-notes =minor-mode= binds the followings keys:

| M-n i   | =org-mpv-notes-insert-link=        | Insert link                                             |
| M-n M-i | =org-mpv-notes-insert-note=        | Insert heading with link                                |
| M-n SPC | =org-mpv-notes-pause=              | Pause/Resume playback                                   |

| M-n =   | =org-mpv-notes-this-timestamp=     | Jump to the timestamp under cursor                      |
| M-n p   | =org-mpv-notes-previous-timestamp= | Jump to previous timestamp found in buffer              |
| M-n n   | =org-mpv-notes-next-timestamp=     | Jump to next timestamp found in in buffer               |
| M-n s   | =org-mpv-notes-save-screenshot=    | Take screenshot and attach it as inline image           |
| M-n M-s | =org-mpv-notes-screenshot-ocr=     | Run OCR on current frame, and insert the text in buffer |
| M-n f   | =org-mpv-notes-seek-forward=       | Seek (i.e. Skip) forward in video                       |
| M-n b   | =org-mpv-notes-seek-backward=      | Seek backwards in video                                 |
| M-n a   | =org-mpv-notes-halve-seek-step=    | Decrease seek step size for next seek forward/backward  |
| M-n d   | =org-mpv-notes-double-seek-step=   | Increase seek step size                                 |
| M-n [   | =org-mpv-notes-speed-up=           | Increase playback speed                                 |
| M-n ]   | =org-mpv-notes-speed-down=         | Decrease playback speed                                 |

Optionally I like to use [[https://github.com/myuhe/smartrep.el][smartrep]] for keybindings. For that you can
use the following use-package config:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-mpv-notes
    :commands (org-mpv-notes-mode org-mpv-notes-open)
    :config
    (define-key org-mpv-notes-mode-map (kbd "M-n") (smartrep-map org-mpv-notes-key-bindings)))
#+end_src

*** Changing preferred backend
By default =mpv.el= is used as the backend to play and control mpv. If =mpv.el= is
not installed =empv.el= is used instead. If both are installed you can specify the
preferred backend as follows:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-mpv-notes-preferred-backend 'empv)
#+end_src
*** Screenshot and OCR
You can take screenshot of the video and place it as inline image in the org file by
using ~M-x~ =org-mpv-notes-save-screenshot=. This will ask mpv to take a
screenshot and then keep a link to the image in org using =org-attach=.
Or if you use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download][org-download]] you can integrate that by doing:

: (setf org-mpv-notes-save-image-function #'org-download-image)

This package can also use any external OCR tool to insert the text
currently shown in the video frame. To do this try ~M-x~
=org-mpv-screenshot-ocr.= The default configuration calls the [[https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html][tesseract]]
program, which you can probably install from your distribution's
repositories. See =org-mpv-notes-ocr-command= and
=org-mpv-notes-ocr-command-args= to change the OCR program.

*** Dealing with a changed path or file name

If a media file to which you had linked has since been renamed or
moved, place POINT on one of the now-broken links and run command ~M-x~
=org-mpv-notes-change-link-reference=. It will ask you for the new
path-spec and make the change for that link only. In order to perform
the change on all occurrences in the org-mode file, run the command
~C-u M-x~ =org-mpv-notes-change-link-reference=.


*** Dealing with manual timestamps

If you have text representations of timestamps in the form /hh:mm:ss/,
and want to convert them to links that can be used by this package,
select the region spanning the timestamps and run command ~M-x~
=org-mpv-notes-replace-timestamp-with-link=. It will prompt you for a
text string representing the link URI.

*** Dealing with subtitles

If you expect that a significant part of your note-taking is going to
amount to transcribing audio, then you can use command ~M-x~
=org-mpv-notes-subtitles-insert= to insert a formatted version of a
local subtitle file into the current buffer. The command will also
give you the option to link all the inserted subtitle timestamps to a
local media file. Currently supported subtitle formats are ~srv1~, ~srv2~,
~srv3~, ~ttml~, and ~vtt~. I'm not aware of =mpv= being able to download
subtitle files, but programs with that feature (eg. [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]],
[[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]], [[https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal][subliminal]]) are probably available in your distribution's
repositories and, of course, you can try manually downloading them.

#+begin_quote
Subtitle files are timestamped at each and every line of screen text.
This creates too many text interruptions for note-taking, so what the
command does is try to identify audio paragraphs and combine them into
single timestamp snippets.
#+end_quote
